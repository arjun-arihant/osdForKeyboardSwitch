# OSD for Keyboard Switch

## Keyboard Layout Monitor

This script is designed to monitor changes in the keyboard layout and display a notification when a change is detected. It's particularly useful for ensuring that you're using the correct keyboard layout for your tasks.

### How it Works

The script continuously checks the keyboard layout at regular intervals. If a change is detected, it displays a notification with the message "SWITCHED". The notification is displayed as an image, which is specified by the `switched.png` file. 

### Usage

Simply run the script. It will start monitoring your keyboard layout. If a change is detected, a notification will be displayed.

### Installation
